Yeehaw, partner! Tired of hoofing it across the dusty plains or getting your boots muddy? This Taxi Service mod turns you into a fancy frontier traveler, summoning magical coaches (wagons, really) to whisk you away. No more "fast travel" â€“ just old-school rides with a driver who won't rob you... probably. This ain't for coders; it's for you, the rootin'-tootin' player who's too lazy to saddle up!
What in Tarnation Does This Do?

Hail a Heap o' Wheels: At special spots, call a coach like you're ordering takeout from the saloon. Pick your ride, destination, and boom â€“ off you go!
Pay the Piper: Fork over some digital dollars based on distance and how posh your wagon is. Don't worry, no stagecoach robberies included (unless the server glitches).
Realistic? Kinda: Driver's invincible, waits if you bail mid-trip (like forgetting your six-shooter), but damage the wagon too much and it's "journey over, cowboy!"

Perfect for RedM servers with RSGCore. If it's not installed, yell at your admin â€“ or just walk, you peasant.
Side-Splittin' Features

Destinations Galore: Zip to Valentine (for hearts and holdups), Rhodes (rhymes with "roads" for a reason), Saint Denis (fancy French for "stuck-up city"), Blackwater (where the water's blacker than your soul), Armadillo (armored dillo not included), Tumbleweed (it literally tumbles), Strawberry (sweet but thorny), Vanhorn (van? In the old west?), or Annesburg (annoyingly far).
Wagon Choices (Because Variety is the Spice of Life... or Dust):

Standard Coach: Comfy like your grandma's rocking chair (base price â€“ cheapskate approved).
Luxury Coach: So premium, you'll feel like a cattle baron (1.5x cost â€“ for when you're flush from poker wins).
Budget Coach: Rattles like a snake in a boot (0.8x price â€“ perfect for broke bandits).


Map Blips: Glowing icons scream "Taxi here!" in Rhodes, Saint Denis, Blackwater, Strawberry, and Annesburg. Follow 'em or get lost â€“ your call, Magellan.
Menu Magic: Pop-up choices for vehicle and spot. Easy as pie... wild west pie, full of bullets.
Goofy Goodies: Enter passenger side only â€“ driver's seat? Nope, you'll get yeeted! Bail out? Driver waits 3 minutes, muttering "Dang tourists." Wreck it? Trip canceled â€“ "Yee-ouch!"

How to Not Die of Boredom (Usage Guide)

Spot the Sign: Hunt fast travel markers (pole things) near towns. Blips help â€“ they're like breadcrumbs for Hansel & Gretel, but with horses.
Yell "Taxi!": Interact with the marker ("Call Wagon" â€“ duh). Menu appears: Pick vehicle first, or it'll nag you like a saloon gal.
Choose & Cruise: Select wagon, then destination. Pay up (base $5 + extras), and watch the coach spawn like a ghost horse.
Board Smart: Jump in passenger door â€“ driver's for the NPC (who's tougher than a two-dollar steak). Relax as he drives; chat with outlaws en route?
Pro Tips: Stay near roads (60 units max, or "No can do, sheriff!"). Exit mid-ride? Hurry back or driver's gone â€“ "Adios, slowpoke!"

Hot Spots (Coords for Cheaters)

Pickup Points: Rhodes (dusty depot), Saint Denis (swampy snobbery), Blackwater (wild west Walmart), Strawberry (berry bad puns), Annesburg (coal-miner's delight).
Drop-Offs: All the above plus extras â€“ coords in the full guide if you wanna GPS your way (old west style: compass and curses).

Notes & Nags (Because Nothing's Perfect)

Server Shenanigans: Fares? Server handles it. No menu? Blame targeting system (rsg or ox â€“ sounds like a bull fight).
Bugs 'n' Giggles: Coach no-show? Road too far â€“ git gud. Driver dumb? Retry. Report to admins: "My wagon's wonky!"
Fun Fact: Driver's bulletproof â€“ test it, but don't blame me when he stares you down like Clint Eastwood.

Saddle up for laughs and lazy travel! If it breaks, it's not my fault â€“ blame the tumbleweeds. Happy trails, you magnificent varmint! ðŸ¤ ðŸš€
